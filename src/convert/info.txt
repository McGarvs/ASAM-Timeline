Desc: Manila trade/trans pacific trade begins with Spanish Galleon trade, including bringing the first Asians to the Americas, many as slaves or sailors forsaking a dreadful return voyage.
Comment: From what I recall about my education, it is pretty crazy that the Spanish Galleon trade is taught without any reference to the Asian Slave Trade.

Comment: In early America, Chinese goods were seen as exotic and luxurious, with China seen as a mysterious land of opportunities for trade. This idea helps to lay a foundation for more modern and problematic concepts of Asians as exotic commodities.

Comment: Afong Moy was many Westerners' first encounter with Asian people. She was exoticized, commodified, and subjected to the American racialization of Asians as perpetual foreigners.

Comment: This failure to recognize non-white people in the eyes of the law is ahborrent and speaks to the longer history of structural racism in the United States. People v. Hall is just one glaring example of how the United States functions on a foundation of white supremacy.

Desc: Following the shooting of a local police officer, the largest mass lynching in United States history occurs in Los Angeles where seventeen Chinese are lynched. A mob of nearly ten percent of the city’s population attacked and dragged Chinese people out of their homes in this violent attack.
Comment: A potent example of Yellow Peril, with whites fearing threat of an Asian invasion. This is only one instance of how this violence tangibly manifested due to the perpetuation of xenophobia and racism in American society.

Comment: The United States supports the Filipino independence movement until the end of the war, and goes on to betray the movement and Filipino people by annexing and violently colonizing the Philippines, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands. In the colonization of the Philippines, the United States introduces the “white man’s burden” ideology and frames the violent colonization of the Philippines as a benevolent act of education, culture, and religion.

Comment: Student and community activism create the first Ethnic Studies Programs in America, and organize in solidarity with Latinos, Native Americans, and African Americans. The continuation of Ethnic Studies today is a powerful act of resistance in which Asian Americans teach, learn, and share their histories. It is an honor to stand in solidarity with Asian American activists and participate in this class.

Desc: Two white automotive workers in Detroit, Michigan were laid off as a result of rising competition with Japanese automakers. Frustrated with their loss of jobs, they wrongfully blamed Vincent Chin, a Chinese man, and brutally beat him to death. They both plead guilty but only received three years of probation and a $3000 fine with no jail time.
Comment: The Murder of Vincent Chin was another instance of gross injustice in the American legal system. The men received less punishment for the murder of a Chinese American man than they would have recieved if they had murdered a dog. It is truly heartbreaking to see how little Asian American lives were and are valued in the United States.

Desc: Atlanta Spa Shootings
Comment: The longer history of fetishizing, dehumanizing, over-sexualizing Asian and Asian American women led to violence in which Asian women in Atlanta, Georgia were murdered. This event eerily echoes ideologies and sentiments of Asian women as exotic, hypersexual, immoral, and commodified objects seen in Afong Moy’s story and the Page Act of 1875. It is evidence that we still have a long way to go in combating racism in American society.
